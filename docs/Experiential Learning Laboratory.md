#**Welcome to Experiential Learning Laboratory**
Experiential learning is an engaged learning process here students "learn by doing" and by reflecting on the experience. Experiences are carefully chosen for their learning potential (i.e. whether they provide opportunities for students to practice and deepen emergent skills, encounter novel and unpredictable situations that support new learning, or learn from natural consequences, mistakes, and successes).
